# Jenkins-CLI

This tool leverages the Jenkins script console to create a terminal-like experience on a Jenkins node. While this could potentially be used to facilitate managing a Jenkins node, it's main purpose is to improve efficiency in offensive security/pentest engagements once an operator gains access to a Jenkins script console.
